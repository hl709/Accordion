# Wordpress Accordion
A wordpress plugin which allows a user to selct different

# Description
Technology Used: Wordpress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP.

The plugin was built originally to display the headings of articles in a blog. It evolved into displaying the articles using a jQuery accodrionnn CSS modal,
and then JavaScipt form validation

# Known Bugs
At the late stage development, an issue emerged where after a user would sort the list of headings, the page wouldn't refresh. This issue was fixed by reloading the page
after blah. The problem occured again after blah was added (fix terminology). Reloading the page with JavaScript didn't work so PHP may be needed to fix this bug.

Virtual Environment (Preferably Oracleâ€™s VirtualBox)
Vagrant
